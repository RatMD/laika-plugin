LAIKA for OctoberCMS
====================

> ![CAUTION]
> This is an experimental OctoberCMS extension and may change at any time. Use it with care and
> expect breaking changes.

Laika is a lightweight bridge that lets OctoberCMS breathe the same modern frontend air as a
Vite-powered Vue application. Instead of abandoning October’s native templating ecosystem, Laika
brings Components, Content Blocks, and Snippets straight into the Vue runtime, where they behave
like first-class citizens.

It provides a familiar Inertia-style workflow, but without forcing you into a full SPA cage.
Server-rendered October content and dynamic Vue components coexist, share data, and actually get
along. Laika handles hydration, Vite bundling, and HMR so you can iterate instantly without losing
the benefits of October’s CMS layer.

In short: October keeps doing its thing, Vue keeps doing its thing, and Laika duct-tapes the two
together so you can build modern interfaces without rewriting your entire project by still using
the same OctoberCMS plugins.
